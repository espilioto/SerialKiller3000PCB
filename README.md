# SerialKiller3000PCB
Very PCB. Much eagle. Wow.

I know having all the revisions saved is overkill, but it's nice seeing my progress (I didn't start using git with eagle till much later).
You can also see the point where I deemed this project worthy enough to send to a PCB [manufacturing company].
(Also, yes, autorouter for the most part. Don't hate me!)

The board turned out really nice, even though I will enlarge the logo on the back a bit, 
add another decoupling cap next to the 12 volt input header and make some other minor changes in the next version.

Renders made with [EagleUp].
